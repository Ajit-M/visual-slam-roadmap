![Visual-SLAM Developer Roadmap - 2021](./img/title.png)

> Roadmap to becoming a Visual-SLAM developer in 2021, inspired by [web-developer-roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap) and [game-developer-roadmap](https://github.com/utilForever/game-developer-roadmap).

Visual-SLAM is a special case of a technology called '[Simultaneous Localization and Mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping)', which you use a camera device to gather exteroceptive sensory data. 

Below there is a set of charts demonstrating topics you need to understand to study Visual-SLAM, and eventually become a Visual-SLAM engineer / researcher.

Visual-SLAM is often portrayed as a technology with a high entry barrier in learning, requiring good C++ programming skills and deep understanding of mathematics.

On the other hand, there are not many introductory level courses provided for beginners, especially in non-English languages. 

I made these charts to share my thoughts and experience on studying Visual-SLAM, and hopefully the beginner learners can get a grasp of where to start from.

<h3 align="center"><strong>Purpose of these Roadmaps</strong></h3>

> The purpose of these roadmaps is to give you an idea about the general idea of Visual-SLAM and to guide you if you are confused about where to start your learning. 

<h3 align="center"><strong>Note to Beginners</strong></h3>

> Acknowledge that SLAM has a relatively high entry barrier, not because of the requirement of undertanding of difficult mathematics, but the requirement of equipping yourself with various types of skills. Don't feel overwhelmed - you don't need to learn everything in the beginning if you are just getting started. Instead, enjoy the journey itself and it will be very rewarding.

If you think that the roadmaps can be improved in any way, please do suggest.

## ðŸš¦ Wrap Up

If you think any of the roadmaps can be improved, please do open a PR with any updates and submit any issues. Also, I will continue to improve this, so you might want to watch/star this repository to revisit.

## ðŸ™Œ Contribution

The roadmaps are built using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/). Project file can be found at `/project-files` directory. To modify any of the roadmaps, open Balsamiq, click **Project > Import > Mockup JSON**, it will open the roadmap for you, update it, upload and update the images in readme and create a PR.
